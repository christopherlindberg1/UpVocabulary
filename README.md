# UpVocabulary
Desktop application that one can use to practice new words in different langiuages. Users create their own vocabularies and add words to them.

**In progress.**

## Description
The purpose of this app is to allow users to easily store words in different languages that they want to learn, and then practice them. All data is provided by the user.

Since users probably will learn some words faster than others, the app will be more likely to generate a word that the user have been struggling with during practice, and less likely to generate a word that the user has already learned.
